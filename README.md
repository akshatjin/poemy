# poemy

poemy will soon be a poetry generator, written in the Python programming
language.

This project was started August 24th, 2012 by Justine Tunney and is still in
its infantile stages of development. But once poemy is finished, it will be
the greatest poetry generator there ever was or ever will be.

Why will poemy be so awesome? Because it'll be able to generate poetry from a
100k+ word dictionary with:

- **Any rhyming scheme**: like couplets, abab,
  [acab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C.A.B.), etc. It'll also be able to do
  feminine rhymes and repeat similar consonants for alliteration.
- **Any meter or rhythm**: like iambic pentameter, trochaic tetrameter,
  anapestic trimeter, etc.
- **Any style**. Poemy will be trained to be capable of picking words and
  sentence structures from various historical and contemporary styles. You
  want a Shakespearean sonnet? No problem. Some dark melancholic goth music
  lyrics? You got it.

What's the catch? The poems won't make any sense. But that doesn't matter
because poetry doesn't have to make sense! But even if you impute poor poemy
for not being able to carry a cohesive thought, you'll still appreciate the
beauty of the words it writes.

poemy will only be able to write poetry in English. There are absolutely no
plans or preparations to support other languages.
