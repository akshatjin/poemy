# poemy

poemy will soon be a poetry generator, written in the Python programming
language.

This project was started August 24th, 2012 by Justine Tunney and is still in
its infantile stages of development. But once poemy is finished, it will be
the greatest poetry generator there ever was or ever will be.

Why will poemy be so awesome? Because it'll be able to generate poetry from a
100k+ word dictionary with:

- **Any rhyming scheme**: like couplets, abab,
  [acab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C.A.B.), etc. It'll also be able to do
  feminine rhymes and repeat similar consonants for alliteration.
- **Any meter or rhythm**: like iambic pentameter, trochaic tetrameter,
  anapestic trimeter, etc.
- **Any style**. Poemy will be trained to be capable of picking words and
  sentence structures from various historical and contemporary styles. You
  want a Shakespearean sonnet? You got it. Some dark melancholic goth music
  lyrics? No problem.

What's the catch? The poems won't make any sense. But that doesn't matter
because poetry doesn't have to make sense! But even if you impute poor poemy
for not being able to carry a cohesive thought, you'll still appreciate the
beauty of the words it writes.

poemy will only be able to write poetry in English. There are absolutely no
plans or preparations to support other languages.

## Example Poem

This poem was generated from the goth corpus in iambic pentameter using a
masculine couplet rhyming scheme:

> we really have to plug my eyes before  
> black angel i feel hunger for the shore  
> which answered not with a caress he died  
> shone for me to the lake of the night tide  
> with sadness here i opened wide the door  
> that scream i hear the angels name lenore  
> i'll show you all the seeming of a trend  
> no reason for you and i don't pretend  
> young soul from the laugh of the desolate  
> your mouth by your voice in my world of hate  
> from those brown hills have melted into spring  
> and dancing in the power of the thing
